# Data Structures

## Arrays

### Basics

* **Definition:** An ordered collection of elements, each identified by an index.
* **Types:**
    * One-dimensional arrays
    * Multi-dimensional arrays (matrices)
* **Indexing:** Accessing elements using their index.
* **Slicing:** Extracting subsets of an array.

### Operations on Arrays
* **Creating arrays:**
    * Using the `list` constructor
    * Using list comprehension
    * Using the numpy.array Function (for NumPy arrays)
* **Accessing elements:**
    * Using index
* **Modifying elements:**
    * Assigning new values
* **Adding/removing elements:**
    * `append`, `insert`, `pop`, `remove`
* **Iterating over arrays:**
    * Using `for` loops
* **Sorting arrays:**
    * Built-in `sort` method
    * Using `sorted` function
* **Searching for elements:**
    * Linear search
    * Binary search (for sorted arrays)

### Advanced Topics
* **Array manipulation:**
    * Reversing
    * Concatenating
    * Copying
* **Multi-dimensional arrays:**
    * Creating and accessing
    * Matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)
* **NumPy library:**
    * Introduction and basic operations
    * Advanced features (broadcasting, slicing, indexing)
